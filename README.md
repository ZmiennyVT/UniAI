## What is UniAI?
Introducing UniAI: Your All-In-One Virtual Assistant Experience </br>
It is a virtual assistant project that will serve as a hub connecting LLM, TTS, STT models, and others, along with the power of the Unity engine. Currently, there is an anime girl as a demo, but the goal is to provide as much flexibility as possible. In the end, you can upload any avatar in the VRM format.

## How to use it?
Currently, in order to use the application, you need API keys for both ElevenLabs and OpenAI - you enter them in the options and can start using the application.
There are plans to add a local solution that does not rely on paid APIs.

## TODO
For MVP:
- [x] Rewrite communication with OpenAI API - 
- [x] Complete UI for OpenAI and ElevenLabs configuration at runtime
- [ ] Add the ability to load your own VRM model

In the long run:
- [ ] Support for other closed and open-source LLMs and TTS
- [ ] Support for other avatar visualization methods - L2D, Talking Face, etc.
- [ ] Add character profiles
- [ ] UI improvements
If you have an idea for something that is not on this list, feel free to write in the discussion or make a PR ^

## The Plan
As mentioned earlier, this project is a virtual assistant project that will serve as a hub connecting LLM, TTS, STT models, and others, along with the power of the Unity engine. Currently, there is an anime girl as a demo, but the goal is to provide as much flexibility as possible.
The long-term goal is to create an easy-to-use platform that supports as many AI models as possible.
