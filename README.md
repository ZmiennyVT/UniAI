## What is UniAI?
Introducing UniAI: Your All-In-One Virtual Assistant Experience </br>
It is a virtual assistant project that will serve as a hub connecting LLM, TTS, STT models, and others, along with the power of the Unity engine. Currently, there is an anime girl as a demo, but the goal is to provide as much flexibility as possible. In the end, you can upload any avatar in the VRM format.

## TODO
For MVP:
- [x] Rewrite communication with OpenAI API - 
- [x] Complete UI for OpenAI and ElevenLabs configuration at runtime
- [ ] Add the ability to load your own VRM model

In the long run:
- [ ] Support for other closed and open-source LLMs and TTS
- [ ] Support for other avatar visualization methods - L2D, Talking Face, etc.
- [ ] Add character profiles
- [ ] UI improvements
If you have an idea for something that is not on this list, feel free to write in the discussion or make a PR ^

## How To Try It Out
Currently, when there is no release for any platform, you need to download Unity version 2021.3.4f1 and run the project yourself.
The project does not have any special requirements, so I plan to release it on Windows and Linux platforms, of course, you can build it on anything you want by yourself.

## The Plan
As mentioned earlier, this project is a virtual assistant project that will serve as a hub connecting LLM, TTS, STT models, and others, along with the power of the Unity engine. Currently, there is an anime girl as a demo, but the goal is to provide as much flexibility as possible.
The long-term goal is to create an easy-to-use platform that supports as many AI models as possible.
